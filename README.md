This project shows a list of Marvel Movies with names that allows search functionality to find particular movies and allows for users to update the list by adding or deleting movie titles. The website can now handle XMLHttpRequests instead of traditional page-reloads. In other words, all data handling is being done through AJAX. External libraries are now handles through package.json.
